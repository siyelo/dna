# Siyelolets

How do bottom-up initiatives get funded? How do you get money to do
something without a budget process?

Answer: If you want something that needs funding, form a Siyelolet. That
is, find others that want the same thing and are willing to pay for it
with their own money. Siyelo can foot the bill initially.

## What is a Siyelolet?

A Siyelolet is a loosely coupled interest group of Siyeloers who want to
co-fund an initiative. Perfect for situations where we don’t really need
everyone at Siyelo involved.

In some cases it does make sense for Siyelo as a whole to fund an
initiative, for example a redesign of our website. For smaller
initiatives the office team or board can just go ahead and do it. For
larger initiatives we may go for a [consensus decision](decisions.html)
at our next [unconference](unconference.html).

But when in doubt (or if in a hurry), go for opt-in and just form a
Siyelolet. Because it’s just so much easier. We may of course decide
later this cost should be Siyelo-global, and in that case simply close
the Siyelolet.

## Sample crisplets

-   **Supporting Doctors Without Borders.** In late 2014 the world was
    suffering a major Ebola crisis, and some of us wanted to support
    [Doctors Without Borders](http://www.msf.org) in their heroic battle
    against the pandemic. Instead of trying to drive consensus for a
    decision on this, one person formed a Siyelolet (one email was all
    it took: "Let’s support Doctors Without Borders, who’s in?"). 9
    people joined and pooled together a donation of EUR 9,000. Siyelo
    paid the donation, and then invoiced each participant individually.
    Pooling the donation into a single large payment made it easier to
    deal with admin overhead and tax issues.
-   **Missing People Siyelolet**: Similar to the above, this Siyelolet
    provides continuous support to [Missing
    People](http://missingpeople.se). People can join and leave as
    they like.
-   **Hack summit**: Most of us love [hack summit](hack-summit.html),
    but again we don’t want to force it upon everyone, so by creating a
    Siyelolet we make sure the costs only affect those who are involved.

## Benefits of forming a Siyelolet

The main benefit to forming a Siyelolet is that we reduce the need for
centralized decision making, and maximize people’s economic freedom.

But why Siyelolets at all? Can’t people just "huddle up and do it"?
True, but the Siyelolet model offer some advantages:

-   **Transparency** - all Siyelolets are listed (at least the
    long-lived ones)
-   **Engagement** - it is easier to get involved if you know what’s
    going on
-   **Established form of collaboration** - the initiator and
    participants of a Siyelolet know what it means.
-   **Economies of scale** - each Siyelolet has a Siyelolet Account that
    is administered by the [office team](office-team.html).
-   **Liquidity** - a Siyelolet can spend money that it doesn’t
    have (yet). For example, with our donation to Doctors Without
    Borders, Siyelo paid the donation and **then** invoiced
    each participant. This works because Siyelo has a cash buffer
    (although limited), and because we trust that each participant will
    pay their part when the time comes.
-   **Responsibility** - Siyelolet Accounts only appear when there are
    actual *individuals* who are prepared to pay. This reduces the risk
    that Siyelo as a whole spends money on stuff that isn’t important,
    or that very few people care about.

## What is required of a Siyelolet

-   A wiki page describing the purpose of the Siyelolet, how
    collaboration is done and who has joined
-   A link from the list of Siyelolets to the wiki page describing the
    Siyelolet
-   All Siyelolets are open for any Siyeloer to join.
-   Every new Siyelolet is announced via an
    [OBS-email](email-conventions.html).

## Sometimes Siyelolets don’t have to pay

Siyelolets are expected to run at a loss (they are basically cost
centers), so each Siyelolet Account can be seen as a short-term loan
from Siyelo to a group of participants. Each participant should expect
to receive an invoice from Siyelo at some point, to cover their part of
the cost.

However, sometimes that doesn’t happen. Sometimes Siyelo will waive the
debt. For example because:

-   The Siyelolet ended up spending money that clearly was to the
    benefit of Siyelo as a whole, so Siyelo will foot the bill.
-   The costs were so low that it’s not worth the administrative hassle
    of invoicing all participants.

The second case is very important, because it basically gives the
[office team](office-team.html) permission to avoid a bunch of
micromanagement and administrative overhead. If 6 people get together to
form a Siyelolet and their costs end up being just SEK 4820 to buy a
license for a tool, then we probably won’t bother invoicing everyone.
Think of it as our "yeah whatever" budget.

By waiving the debt, Siyelo can avoid unnecessary administration of
costs that are clearly in the common interest, or clearly too small to
bother with.

All in all we are really happy with the Siyelolet model, because it make
it easy for people to collaborate on stuff without a bunch of upfront
budgeting or permission-seeking.
