# Courses and event production

Although we are at heart a consulting company, we do offer quite a lot
of courses and seminars. In fact, every week we run 1-2 public courses
at our office in Stockholm. So how does that work with our model?

## How we do courses

Siyelo itself doesn’t really run courses, it just provides the platform.

Anyone at Siyelo can organize a course (or any kind of event), and when
they do so they implicitly take on the Producer role for that course.

Driving principles:

-   Each course or event has a Producer
-   As Producer, you "own" the course. You are responsible for the
    course as whole, including course design, quality, marketing, etc.
-   As Producer, you use the Siyelo Calendar (a shared Google calendar)
    to book the classroom and make sure there isn’t a conflict.
-   As Producer, you own the financial result of your course (win
    or loss). Just like with consulting, Siyelo retains X% of your
    profit (see [economic model](economic-model.html)).
-   Siyelo’s role is to be the "platform", providing things such as a
    classroom (we have a classroom at our office in Stockholm), onsite
    assistance (serving coffee & snacks, etc) and lots of administrative
    support (invoices, lunch reservation, email communication,
    registration page, etc). The [office team](office-team.html)
    organizes all of that.
-   Siyelo will charge the producer a fixed course admin fee (usually
    around €600-700 per day), an all-inclusive fee that covers the cost
    of the office and all administrative support.

The Producer doesn’t necessarily have to teach the course (although
that’s the most common case). Sometimes a producer will invite a "star"
(someone outside of Siyelo who is a well-known "guru" within his/her
field) and host or co-teach a course.

## Example

Here’s a high-level summary of what happens with a typical course:

1.  Joe decides to teach an Agile Engineering course.
2.  Joe opens the Siyelo calendar on Google, finds an open slot Feb
    12-13, and writes "LOKAL: Agile Engineering course (Joe)". (LOKAL
    means "venue" in Swedish, our convention for booking different parts
    of the office)
3.  Joe asks the [office team](office-team.html) to set up a
    registration page. He has taught this course before, so they
    copy-paste from last course instance.
4.  Joe synchronizes with other producers to make sure his course is
    mentioned in the next marketing email (see next section below).
5.  Registrations start coming in. We have a home-grown tool to process
    registrations and send email confirmations. Course registrations
    automatically end up in Google Spreadsheet.
6.  About a week before the course, the office team sends a welcome
    email to the course participants
7.  Feb 12 arrives. Joe shows up at Siyelo. Breakfast is served,
    handouts printed, everything ready to go thanks to the awesome
    office team!
8.  This is also the day when the office team sends invoices
    to participants. They will also follow up on payment.
9.  At the end of the course, he asks people to fill in a course
    feedback sheet. He notes some improvement ideas, calculates the Net
    Promoter Score, and adds a row to our shared Course Log (see
    Quality below).
10. The office team sends an email to all course participants with a
    link to course materials and such. They also add the course
    participants to our mailing list for future event notifications
    (they can of course opt out at any time)
11. Joe figures out the course profit and sends an invoice to Siyelo
    (minus the [Siyelo tax](economic-model.html), just like with
    any consulting).

## Quality and customer feedback

We are pretty systemic when it comes to course quality. For every
course, the Producer is expected to measure [Net Promoter
Score](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter) (NPS) and post it on
the Course Log (a shared spreadsheet listing all courses and basic data
such as who produced it, how many participants showed up, NPS, etc).

The purpose of the course log is to provide internal transparency, so we
can learn from each other’s successes and failures. It’s not mandatory
(very few things are), but we encourage each other to fill it in.

We also do a lot of pair-teaching and informal visits to each other’s
courses. As a result, we gradually improve all the time! Nowadays most
courses have NPS &gt;70%, the best ones consistently get 80-90%,
sometimes even 100%! Almost none get below 30%. And it shows too - we
often hear things like "I signed up for this course because my colleague
insisted I should go!" Participants also appreciate the fact that none
of our teachers are full-time - they are all consultants doing "real
world" stuff as well.

Nevertheless, we do expect new and experimental courses (or less
experienced teachers) to start with a lower NPS. And there’s no shame in
that, as long as you keep experimenting and improving :o)

## Marketing

Some of our courses market themselves (as in, previous participants
recommend it, or the teacher is famous). Just post the registration page
and it fills up!

Other courses are new and need a bit of exposure. So about once or twice
per quarter we send an email to our customer list (all previous course
participants). We store our customer data in
[Insightly](https://www.insightly.com) and send marketing emails using
[MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com).

Typically one of the producers of an upcoming course will take lead on
this, talk to other producers, agree on what should be in the email
(usually via a shared Google Doc), and send the email. They will of
course also market the courses through their personal networks,
LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and whatever other channels make sense. If
a course needs an extra push they might ask other Siyeloers to retweet,
etc.

## What if people don’t sign up?

Together we have a really big network so most courses at least brake
even. In some cases, however, the registrations just don’t come in, and
if it’s really bad we have to cancel.

Fortunately, Siyelo doesn’t charge the Producer for a course if it got
canceled. It’s like a small insurance (or failure cushion). As a result,
the cost of canceling a course is quite low for the producer (except for
damaged pride). Why? Because we *want* people to experiment with new
types of courses, since that benefits everyone in the long run. Make
innovation easier by minimizing the cost of failure!

### Fake it till you make it

A few Siyeloers puts up registrations for courses for which no course
material exists. If no one signs up, then no one is harmed. If enough
people sign-up, then there can be a mad scramble to create the course
the few weeks before the course. This may not sound like a serious way
to run things, but in a way it is like a lean startup - make a minimal
product and see if it flies. And regardless of how professional a course
may seem, the first time it was held the teachers were out on a limb and
very nervous about it.

This model works as long as nobody gets too reckless! Too many canceled
courses would hurt the Siyelo brand (see [how we build the
brand](brand-building)). So far that hasn’t been a problem though.
