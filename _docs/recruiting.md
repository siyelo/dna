# Recruitment - how we grow

## We are in no hurry to grow

We don’t actively recruit consultants. There’s no economic incentive to
do so, and each new addition makes Siyelo a bit more anonymous, a bit
less personal, and a bit harder to coordinate.

## So… how do we grow?

Like vampires, fresh blood makes us stronger. New people who are smart
and passionate will challenge the status quo and inject new ideas! That
compensates for the pain of growing.

The right balance seems to be about 1-3 new consultants per year, so
that’s what we aim for. Enough to keep us on our toes without excessive
growth pain. Very few people have ever left Siyelo (we’re not just like
vampires, we’re mafia vampires), so our rate of growth has been pretty
linear.

OK, maybe vampire isn’t the best metaphor. But you get the idea :o)

## Hire awesome people, or don’t hire at all

Worth repeating: **hire awesome people, or don’t hire at all!**
That’s what [makes our model work](why-this-works.html).

## Who gets to join

We don’t have an HR department or recruiters, so there’s not much
bandwidth or interest to headhunt people. However, we’re fortunate to
have a steady stream of interesting people knocking on the door, so
we’re lazy and go for the safe bets.

Our minimum bar is:

1.  The candidate is “konsultmässig” (roughly translates to “a great
    consultant”). That is, we are confident that the candidate will have
    happy clients.
2.  The candidate is social, and we must actually *like* the person and
    look forward to hanging out together for years, or even decades.
3.  At least one us has worked with the candidate before (and can
    therefore testify to the first two points). We want someone to say
    “Hey, I’ve worked with her before, she’s awesome! We’d be IDIOTS not
    to let her join!”

This considerably limits the number of applicants.

Other things that we value (but don’t always require):

-   The candidate complements us somehow, for example with new skills or
    perspectives that we lack. He/she will make us feel like newbies in
    some area!
-   The candidate has lots of energy and ideas, and won’t be shy to
    challenge the status quo.
-   The candidate is well known and has a strong reputation in
    the industry.

> Tips to candidates: Inspire us! Show us your skills, technical and
> social! Present something new and exciting at one of our events, or
> join us for a [hack summit](hack-summit.html). Prepare for lots of
> intense discussions, critique and laughter – we’re a merry bunch, but
> we need to be convinced you are good at what you do. Why? Because we
> want to learn from you, and we want the clients to rave over how
> awesome you are. We’ve spent more than 5 years building up a great
> reputation, and we want you to make it even better!

## Don’t steal people from clients!

One golden rule as a consultant is to never ever hire a co-worker from a
client. Managers obviously don’t want consultants to steal their
employees, so we don’t even discuss recruitment with a candidate until
after both the candidate and the consultant have left the place where
they worked together. Sometimes years after.

Again, we are in no hurry to grow. An awesome person is worth waiting
for.

## What kind of people don’t fit at Siyelo?

People who want stability don’t fit at Siyelo. You won’t have stable
working hours and a fixed desk. You won’t even get a fixed salary - in
fact, it’s the other way around - you pay a fee (but keep most of what
you earn). See the [economic model](economic-model.html). So when you
don’t have a client, you bleed money every month! On the other hand,
when you do have a client, you earn more than what any company would pay
you in salary. So it’s up to you to buffer cash and manage risk.

This kind of model obviously doesn’t fit everyone.

## What kind of people do fit at Siyelo?

Most people who end up at Siyelo were previously independent consultants
(or were heading in that direction). Typical personality traits:

-   **Self-confident** - they know that they are highly skilled and in
    high demand.
-   **Adventurous** - a few months without an assignment isn’t the end
    of the world, it’s an opportunity to play around and learn new
    stuff!
-   **Social** - they like to maintain a strong network and collaborate
    with people. Some of us are introverts, but still kind of social :o)
-   **Curious** - want to learn new things, every day. Love geeking out
    on new technologies, processes, etc.
-   **Generous** - like to share what they learn, not primarily for
    profit but because it’s fun and rewarding in itself.
-   **Responsible** - they’re used to taking responsibility for their
    own goals and actions, and don’t wait for others to tell them what
    to do or solve their problems.

Of course, not everyone at Siyelo has all these traits. But this is
typically the type of person who is attracted to Siyelo.

## What’s the recruitment process?

It’s quite simple:

1.  Mr X (a candidate) approaches Mrs Y (a Siyeloer) and asks to
    join Siyelo.
2.  Y does what it takes to evaluate X. Start by finding out which
    Siyeloers have worked with Mr X before and that they think of him.
    Then organize interviews and tests and whatever else she
    deems necessary. She might invite X to join the next [hack
    summit](hack-summit.html).
3.  If Y thinks X is suitable, she emails all Siyeloers: “I think X
    should be a Siyeloer, because \[reasons\]. Anyone against?”.
4.  If no response comes within a few days, the decision is done!
    Otherwise, if people have doubts or questions, keep repeating points
    2-3 until the candidate is accepted or rejected.

All active candidates have a “puller”, in this case Mrs Y. That’s our
internal term for the person “pulling” an initiative and making sure
things move forward, and that the candidate is well-treated. Similar to
the bun holder in our [bun protocol](bun-protocol.html).

Bottom line: As long as even one single Siyeloer is against hiring a
candidate, we won’t do it. We’re not really fond of vetoes, but for
recruiting it feels motivated. We prefer the risk of rejecting a good
candidate, over the risk of accepting a bad candidate.

## How does on-boarding work?

Welcome! You’ll need to sign our [team contract](team-contract-en.html),
and create your own personal company (if you don’t already have one).
Formally you’ll be employed by your company, not Siyelo. We’ll help you
get started.

Congrats, you are now your own manager! Be nice.

We will also go for dinner at a nice restaurant, setup your email
account and all that jazz, like most other companies. And we’ll proudly
display you on our [site](https://www.siyelo.com/consultants) of course!
