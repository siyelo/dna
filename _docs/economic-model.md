# Economic Model

The high level economic model is summarized in [How Siyelo
Works](how-siyelo-works.html). Here are some concrete examples to make
it more clear.

## Example: One month

Suppose Joe is a Siyelo consultant, and his current client is Initech.
Joe’s consulting fee is €100 per hour. And suppose the current Siyelo
fee is 10% + €500/month.

1.  During January, Joe does 100 hours of work for Initech.
2.  At the end of January, Joe adds one row to the invoicing spreadsheet
    (a single shared Google doc for everyone at Siyelo), noting that
    Initech should be invoiced €10,000 for January.
3.  The [office team](office-team.html) sends a €10,000 invoice from
    Siyelo to Initech, for Joe’s services.
4.  Joe sends a €9,000 invoice from his personal company to Siyelo
    (€10,000 minus the 10% Siyelo “tax”).

**Result for January:**
Initech pays €10,000, Joe earns €9,000, Siyelo earns €1,000.

In addition, once per quarter Siyelo will send a €1500 invoice to Joe’s
company (3 x €500, the monthly fixed fee).

So let’s put it all together.

## Example: One year

Suppose Joe earns the same amount as above, every month for a year. In
that case the net result is:

-   Initech paid €120,000 for Joe’s services (€10,000 x 12 months)
-   Joe earned €108,000 for his work at Initech (90% of the income
    from Initech)
-   Siyelo earned €12,000 from Joe’s work at Initech (10% of the income
    from Initech)
-   In addition, Joe paid €6000 to Siyelo in fixed fees (€500 x
    12 months)
-   **Result for the year:**
    -   Initech: -€120,000
    -   Joe: +€102,000
    -   Siyelo: +€18,000

## Example: hitting the ceiling

Suppose the Siyelo fee ceiling is €20,000 per year.

And suppose Joe gets famous for his specialty skills in cybersecurity,
and manages to land a €200/hour gig at Cyberdyne (something about
robots, they’re very secretive about it)! Joe still works 100 hours per
month (reserving the rest of his time for hobby projects and family).

That means Joe will pull in about €240,000, which means the Siyelo fee
would be €24,000. That’s way past the €20,000 ceiling, and we haven’t
even taken the fixed €500/month into account. The point of having a
ceiling is to make sure the cost of being at Siyelo doesn’t get out of
hand for the highest paid consultants.

Joe tells the office team that he’s most likely going to hit the ceiling
this year, so there’s no point bothering with the % fee. Instead, Joe
keeps 100% of what he earns, and Siyelo just invoices him the ceiling
fee of €5000 per quarter (= €20,000 per year divided into 4 quarters).
Simple.

If he turns out to be wrong (because Cyberdyne cancels his engagement)
then they’ll have to go back and recalculate. No big deal, it’s just an
internal calculation that the customers don’t see.

## Example: adjusting the fees

At the end of the fiscal year, the [board](board.html) notices that
Siyelo is accumulating too much money (we want to maintain a limited
liquidity buffer and not build up piles of cash), so they lower the fee
to 9% + €400/month, and lower the ceiling to €18,000/year. Yay!

Check [how Siyelo works](how-siyelo-works.html) if you are curious about
why we don’t want Siyelo to earn a big profit.

## What about taxes and VAT?

Taxes and VAT? Oh yes, that messes up the clean calculations above… :o)

We have experts hired to deal with that, and much of that is
country-specific, so we won’t bore you with details.

## What about risk pooling? What if someone gets in financial trouble?

What if a consultant can’t find a client for an extended period? Or what
if a client suddenly goes bankrupt and doesn’t pay? What if a consultant
gets seriously sick?

In a “normal” consulting company, consultants get their salary every
month and the employer needs to prepare for risks using things like cash
buffers and insurances. But Siyelo is more like a bunch of collaborating
independents, and we leave it up to each individual to manage risk and
insurance in their own company.

Nevertheless it may sound obvious that Siyelo should provide a “rainy
day insurance” for each consultant, a shared cash buffer to support a
consultant who runs into sudden cash flow problems. But that money needs
to come from somewhere, and will in one way or another cause the Siyelo
fee to increase.

Different people have different risk profiles. Some are very careful,
keep their expenses low, and buffer lots of cash for rain day. Some are
less careful, spend most of what they earn, and get involved in risky
projects that may or may not pay off. Also, some people are good at
managing their money, while others are sloppier.

As a result, our discussions always end up with people divided into two
camps:

-   **Yes**: “An insurance will increase my freedom and security,
    because Siyelo will help me if I run into temporary cash
    flow problems.”
-   **No**: “An insurance will decrease my freedom and security, because
    of the increased fees. I manage risk fine today by saving cash and
    minimizing unnecessary expenses.”

This is where our [explicitly stated core values](what-is-siyelo.html)
come into use. Freedom is a core value, financial stability isn’t. That
doesn’t mean financial stability isn’t important, it just means that
people came to Siyelo primarily for freedom, and that includes the
freedom to choose your own risk-management approach.

This reasoning always leads us to the same conclusion:

-   **Compromise**: “Some people want a shared insurance, some don’t.
    Therefore we won’t force it upon everyone. Instead, those
    individuals who want an insurance (and are willing to pay for it)
    can get together and form one together. That way, insurance
    is opt-in.”

So anyone who wants to do risk-pooling is free to propose a model and
see if anyone wants to join, but insurance isn’t owned or managed by
Siyelo. Perfect case for a [Siyelolet](crisplets.html).

Interestingly enough, no such generic insurance has been created yet,
because nobody has managed to define a model that is good enough to
attract a critical mass of participants.

> The closest thing we have is the “10k club”, an opt-in risk pool
> designed to handle the specific case where a client doesn’t pay your
> invoice (because the client has cash-flow problems, or is being evil).
> As member of the 10k club you say “If another Siyeloer doesn’t get
> paid for his/her job, I’m willing to donate SEK 10,000. Unless it
> happens too often, or I can’t afford to pay right now.” Note that the
> 10k club supports everyone at Siyelo, not just other members (the idea
> is that, if someone outside the club receives payout, they will be
> morally inclined to join the club afterwards). As of 2014 we had 9
> members, so anyone who gets in trouble can get a donation of SEK
> 90,000 on short notice. Nobody has used the insurance yet, but it
> feels nice to have, it doesn’t encroach on anyone’s freedom, and the
> admin overhead is basically zero. Very Siyeloy.
