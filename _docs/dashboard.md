# Siyelo Dashboard

The dashboard is an internal shared google spreadsheet containing our
most vital shared information. It started with just the [happiness
index](happiness-index.html), and then we gradually added more sheets to
it.

Here’s a [Crisp Dashboard template &
example](https://docs.google.com/a/crisp.se/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApEy2bnWDb5fdG1QZzZSeUhFQWJEc2pEdkVDOHkySEE)

The dashboard contains:

-   **Happiness index** - how happy are we and why?
-   **Happiness history** - how has the happiness index developed over
    time?
-   **Capacity & availability** - who needs a new client?
-   **Competency matrix** - who is good at what, and who is interested
    in what?
-   **Decision log** - which Siyelo-wide decisions have been made?
-   **Fee income** - how much money is Siyelo earning every month?
-   **Revenue per consultant** - economic figures on a person-by-person
    basis

## Who is responsible for keeping it up to date?

We share the responsibility. When any part starts looking old, someone
will usually take action (like emailing the team list “Hey guys, time to
update the happiness index!”).

Some sheets have implicit owners. For example “fee income” and “revenue
per consultant” are usually maintained by someone on the office team or
the board, since they have better access to the raw economic figures
(and are better at interpreting the numbers).

In general, if any sheet goes unmaintained for a long time, that’s a
signal that it isn’t important and should be removed from the dashboard.
