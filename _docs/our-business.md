# Our business

Formally, Siyelo doesn’t really have a business area. We are consultants
and people can do whatever they want. Nothing about our model is
specific to any domain or industry.

In practice though, because of our history and the people who happen to
work at Siyelo, we’ve evolved two main business areas:

1.  **Software development**. Mostly on top of the Java VM. Mostly
    longer engagements and close to full-time.
2.  **Agile/Lean coaching and training**. Mostly shorter engagements
    or part-time.

That is, most Siyeloers happen to spend most of their time in one of
those two areas. Some have one foot in each though.

> Example: Some time around 2006 Henrik started writing books and
> articles on agile stuff, and clients started asking for agile
> coaching. This was a new business area for Siyelo, but he didn’t have
> to ask for permission - he just went ahead and did it! And gradually
> other people within Siyelo started getting interested, and we
> attracted new Siyeloers with a coaching profile. Within a few years,
> Siyelo had become pretty much a world leader within the field of agile
> coaching and training. And without any formal decision to even enter
> that business. Pretty cool! Here’s more on how we [build the
> brand](brand-building.html).

Also, there are some [industries that we
avoid](industries-that-we-avoid.html).

## Different “species” of Siyeloers

We sometimes use a funny animal metaphor to talk about different types
of engagements. Most Siyeloers fall into one of these categories
(although it can change over time). At our bi-yearly
[unconference](unconference.html) all animals get together on a rock and
make noise together!

## Seal consultants

A Seal is faithful and dedicated to one single client pretty much
full-time. The Seal consultant takes a deep breath, dives in, and then
stays under water with the client for months (hmmm… perhaps Whale would
be a better metaphor). Seals normally don’t have as much time for other
stuff such as teaching courses, but we do attend a few conferences. Once
in a while a Seal will pop up above the surface, take a deep breath &
learn some new stuff, perhaps find a new client, and then dive deep
again.

Seal work takes patience and dedication. You need to take special care
not to go too deep too long (you might get [the
bends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness)), and
remember to come up for breath once in a while to expand your horizons.
You also need to select your clients carefully since the decision has a
big impact on your daily life.

Seals are usually cute and playful.

## Albatross consultants

Some of us are Albatross consultants. We sail around high in the sky and
travel great distances. Once in a while we plunge into the water and
grab a juicy fish, then up into the sky again. The Albatross gets to see
many different places – but doesn’t stay still long enough to get to
know any single client well. The Albatross is flexible and free. No
client will complain if the Albatross decides to spend a week attending
a conference or writing a book. On the downside, the Albatross spends a
significant amount of his time coordinating with his clients and
fiddling with his schedule trying to make everything fit together.

The Albatross has to be careful not to sail too high into the clouds and
lose touch with reality (or get [the altitude
bends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_sickness)). It can get
lonely and insecure up there in the sky, always on the move, not having
your own cozy little cubicle to call home. The returns are great but
freedom does have a price.

Albatrosses are usually swift and graceful. They can also be a bit
absent-minded and noisy.

## Duck consultants

Some of us are Duck consultants – a compromise between the Seal and the
Albatross.

Like the Seal, we have one specific client that we focus on. Unlike the
Seal, however, we don’t spend all our time under water with that one
client. Like the Albatross, we sometimes spread our wings and visit
other clients or teach courses or attend conferences. But the Duck has
one particular pond that he likes to return to, a client that has gotten
to know well and perhaps spends one or two days per week with. Long
enough to get to know the client, but not long enough to get below the
surface.

Ducks are usually pretty and funny. They look calm, but underneath the
surface they are paddling furiously!

## Anglerfish consultants

![Anglerfish consultant](/assets/anglerfish-500.jpg "Anglerfish consultant"):https://www.flickr.com/photos/23629083@N03/15377775448/

Some of us used to be Anglerfish consultants before joining Siyelo.

Anglerfish are way down in the dark, lost, wandering aimlessly with
nothing but a small artificial light to guide them. Sometimes they are
lucky and manage to attract a small fish. As opposed to the Albatross,
the Anglerfish can’t see the horizon and doesn’t choose where to go – it
just floats around and eats whatever scraps it happens to bump into. The
Anglerfish never goes up to the surface to see the big picture or learn
something new – in fact, he doesn’t even know the direction to the
surface.

Anglerfish are usually ugly and scary. Fortunately we don’t have any at
Siyelo :o)
