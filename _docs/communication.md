# Communication

Our **main internal communication channels** are:

-   [Siyelo Unconference](unconference.html) twice per year.
-   Pulse meetings (or mini-conferences). These happen about twice per
    year, in between the unconferences. Typically a half day or whole
    day with some kind of theme, like “how we make decisions” or “how we
    handle conflict” or “how we run courses”.
-   Team mailing list - a single mailing list with everyone on it. We
    use simple [email conventions](email-conventions.html) to separate
    must-read stuff from general discussions, and the [Bun
    protocol](bun-protocol.html) to route client inquiries to the
    right consultant.
-   [Board meetings](board.html) every month.
-   [Flowdock](http://www.flowdock.com) for chattier stuff (Slack came a
    close 2nd.)

Most decisions are made, and most problems solved, in one of the above
forums.

A lot of good communication also happens at our
[hack-summit](hack-summit.html), although the purpose is more to geek
out together than to communicate :)

Where we **store info**:

-   Google Docs - we used it for almost everything now a days. Our main
    doc is the [dashboard](dashboard.html)
-   Wiki - used to be our communication hub, but now it’s rarely used
    (because of google docs)
-   Dropbox - we have a dropbox business account that we used for shared
    docs that don’t fit in google docs.
-   GitHub - a github organization account for shared code and, well,
    the Siyelo DNA that you are reading right now.

How we **communicate with the outside world**:

-   Our website - [www.siyelo.com](http://www.siyelo.com)
-   Our blog - [blog.siyelo.com](http://blog.siyelo.com)
-   A mailing list for our customers and course participants, we send
    information about upcoming courses about once or twice per quarter.
-   Twitter - our twitter handle is
    [@siyelo](https://twitter.com/siyelo/)
-   [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/siyelo.com)
-   … but the biggest channel of communication is of course the personal
    and informal channels - Siyeloers tweeting, blogging, and talking to
    friends and customers. Together we have a huge network!
