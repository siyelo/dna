# How we do sales

Siyelo consultants mostly sell themselves and each other. Most of our
sales is reactive (clients contacting us) rather than proactive (us
contacting clients). That’s why we don’t have a sales department
(although we do have a business developer, explained further down) - our
strong [brand](brand-building.html) minimizes the need to “chase”
clients.

As a consultant or contractor, timing is a huge challenge. How likely is
it that my next client, client B, will come knocking on the door
precisely when I’m done with client A? Forget it! Instead, client B will
get in touch while I’m still busy with client A. Or I’ll finish with
client A, and there’s no other client knocking on the door. Consultants
tend to have too much work or too little work, never just enough.

The solution is *load balancing* - having a group of trusted colleagues
that you can send clients to and receive clients from. And that’s
exactly what Siyelo is - a bunch of trusted colleagues!

The [bun protocol](bun-protocol.html) is our main tool for routing
client requests between each other. It helps connect the right client
with the right consultant at the right time, which benefits everyone!
And it works pretty OK without any kind of central control :o)

## How do we handle conflicts, such as two consultants competing for the same client gig?

See the [bun protocol](bun-protocol.html) page for answers to that and
many similar questions about how we route clients internally.

## Do we have a “finders fee” for finding client gigs for each other?

Nope. If you pass a client on to a colleague, you won’t earn a provision
or finder’s fee or anything like that. Why? Because the underlying
[purpose of Siyelo](what-is-siyelo.html) is not to maximize profit, it
is to maximize [happiness](happiness-index.html). We earn money from our
clients, not from each other.

## What about the business developer role?

Our business developer adds an element of pro-activeness and long-term
strategy to our otherwise mostly reactive sales process.

As opposed to most traditional consulting companies, her job is *not* to
maximize profit or sell as many consulting hours as possible. Instead,
she optimizes for the [happiness index](happiness-index.html), which
means learning and adapting to each person’s individual needs. Some want
to work a lot, some don’t. Some want a lot of help with sales, some want
just a little bit of support, some don’t need any help at all.

The business developer complements the consultants by focusing on things
like long-term strategy, seeing connections between different clients
we’re working with, networking with possible future strategic clients,
spotting market trends, etc. As an individual consultant that kind of
stuff is harder, because you spend most of your time in the trenches
with client X.

The business developer also provides practical assistance around the
sales process, things like contracts and negotiation that many
consultants are bad at (or just don’t like dealing with).

## Does the business developer earn a provision?

No. The business developer is strictly speaking a contractor, but her
only client is Siyelo and she charges a fixed fee per month.

We’ve found that monetary incentive schemes invite sub-optimization
(yes, even in sales). People tend to focus on whatever gives them a
bigger bonus, instead of what truly benefits the company. Instead we
just pay a good fee and trust that the business developer works in the
best interests of the company (just like everyone else at Siyelo).

Monetary incentives are often pitched as way to motivate people to work
smart and improve, but we find that transparency and feedback is a much
simpler and better way.

## Is the business developer an employee?

No, she is a contractor. We let people choose which model they want. Our
default is to minimize the number of Siyelo employees (because it causes
more admin overhead), so almost everyone at Siyelo is strictly speaking
a subcontractor rather than an employee. But the [office
team](office-team.html) wanted a more traditional employee-employer
setup, which is fine.

## What power does the business developer have?

No formal powers at all! Although, like with all Siyeloers, there’s
plenty of *informal power* to go around :o)

In more typical consulting companies, sales people and business
developers “own” their “resources” and can move and allocate them to
clients as needed. At Siyelo, however, we have no managers; people are
people (not resources) and are free to do whatever they want! Since the
business developer can’t force anyone to do anything, she needs to work
in close collaboration with the consultants. Basically, check with Jim
before offering him to a client!

This makes the job a bit more complex, but the returns are very high,
because [motivated consultants do a *much* better
job](why-this-works.html).
