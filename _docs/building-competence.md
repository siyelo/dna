# Building competence

As shown in [Why this works](why-this-works.html), competence is
crucial! If we don’t keep building competence, our model will probably
stop working in the long run.

Fortunately, Siyelo is built around individuals who love learning
anyway, so it’s really just a matter of making sure nothing gets in the
way! So we don’t have training budgets and approval processes and things
like that, we just trust people to manage their own money and take
responsibility for their own competence development.

Here are some things we do to keep learning:

-   Our bi-yearly [unconference](unconference.html)
-   [Hack Summit](hack-summit.html) - two days off site, relaxing and
    geeking out together
-   RD - a meetup where someone presents something interesting that
    they’ve learned recently (see above). Here’s a page in Swedish which
    lists the [topics we talked about from
    2002-2012](https://www.siyelo.com/om-crisp/crisp-internutbildning)
-   GDWS - Get Drunk With Siyelo - a pub night that happens from time to
    time
-   Invite our favorite gurus and rock stars to come to Stockholm and
    teach courses or co-train with us
-   Peer-coaching workshops, where the agile coaches meet to help each
    other solve problems
-   Active [mailing list](mail-conventions.html) and chat
-   Write [articles](http://blog.siyelo.com) and
    [books](https://www.siyelo.com/bocker-och-produkter) (sometimes
    in pairs).
-   Create and teach [courses](https://www.siyelo.com/courses) (gives
    the teacher a very strong motivation to learn the topic!)
-   Pair-coach and pair-teach - lets us steal tricks from each other
-   Share all course material with each other (mostly via Dropbox and
    Google Drive)

Some of these forums are very active and some less so, it varies over
time. But it sure adds up to a lot of opportunity to learn!

At the end of the day, though, it’s up to each consultant to reserve the
time needed to learn new stuff, and not always be 100% booked up with
grunt work.
