# Board of directors

Being a Swedish company, we are required to have a board of directors.
In most companies, the board is appointed by the owners to represent
them so that the management group, headed by the CEO, runs the company
according to the directives from the owners and the board.

At Siyelo, this works a little differently. First of all, [we invite all
Siyeloers to become owners after 2 years](ownership-model.html), and
second, we hold a yearly election of the board members where all
Siyeloers (owners or not) have the right to vote. Since [we have gotten
rid of the CEO role](decisions.html), and since we have very autonomous
consultants, there is really quite little to manage.

## What does the board do?

The board have monthly board meetings. The most important
responsibilities are to make sure the financial aspect of Siyelo is OK
and that the Siyeloers and the [office team](office-team.html) are
happy. The meetings are open for any Siyeloers to attend if they wish.

Managing the finances involves keeping an eye on the liquidity to be
able to do day-to-day business and to aim for a zero result at the end
of the fiscal year. See [Economic Model](economic-model.html) for
details.

If there is any Siyeloer with a low score on [Happiness
Index](happiness-index.html), a board members takes it upon themselves
to call that person and to try and find out what can be done to make the
Siyeloer happier.

This is the template for our monthly board meetings.

1.  Election of meeting secretary, chairman and attestant
2.  Schedule next meeting
3.  Information round
4.  Walk-through of previous protocol and action points
5.  Walk-through of economy
6.  Walk-through of [Happiness Index](happiness-index.html)
    -   The board creates action points to call any Siyeloers that have
        a low score on Happiness Index.

7.  Important calendar events
8.  Are there any blockers for the office?
9.  Free topics
    -   Topic suggestions on post-it notes
    -   Prioritization
    -   Work through the topics

## How do we elect the board?

We elect the board annually at the [Siyelo
Unconference](unconference.html) in the fall. Our board consists of four
people

1.  Chairman
2.  Board member 1
3.  Board member 2
4.  Board alternate

### The current election process

Before the election starts, Siyeloers who volunteer to run for the board
of directors put their name up for consideration on a dedicated wall
somewhere. Often, there is some flattering going on to encourage people
to volunteer. We usually end up with two or three candidates for the
Chairman position, and some additional Siyeloers volunteering to make up
the rest of the board.

When it is time for the election, all Siyeloers gather in a big circle.
One of the Unconference facilitators manages the election process, where
we elect one member at a time, in the order listed above, using closed
voting and relative majority.

For each position on the board:

1.  Any Siyeloer may nominate any Siyeloer.
2.  Nominees who accept the nomination are given the opportunity to
    offer a short motivation for why to vote for them.
3.  Each Siyeloer casts a vote by writing the name of their favourite
    candidate on a piece of paper, and putting it in a basket in the
    middle of the circle.
4.  When everyone has voted, 2-3 people count the votes in front of
    the group. The candidate with the largest number of votes is
    announced the winner without further ado.

We repeat this process until all four positions are filled.

Since we vote for one position at a time, we have the possibility to
vote for a strong team. Let’s say the chairman is an intuitive agile
coach, then, maybe, people will vote for a thoughtful programmer in the
next round to balance the team.
Past practice that has emerged, the board usually consist of one from
our office staff, one programmer and one agile coach.

### History and future direction

This process has evolved from trying lots of different ones, here are
two examples of former processes:

-   One man nomination committee that talked to everyone to hear their
    opinion and then put together a suggestion that always got elected.
    -   pros: put together a team.
    -   cons: lack of transparency, didn’t scale
-   Closed vote, the 3 people with most votes became the board.
    -   pros: easy and fair, scales
    -   cons: still lack of transparency, not possible to vote for a
        team only individuals, not all different views would get
        represented

We are currently looking to change how we elect the board to one based
on the Sociocracy election process to get more reasoning about the
composition and feedback to the nominated people.
